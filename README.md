 AliExpress Clone

Created mainly as an exercise and almost everything is copied from [John Weeks](https://github.com/John-Weeks-Dev/aliexpress-clone). 
I didn't learn to build a Nuxt project from scratch per se, but coming from Vue.js I did learn the structure and concept of NuxtJS, Tailwindcss, Prisma and how Supabase + OAuth works in these kind of applications. 

To run this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/DepTrai95/aliexpress-clone.git

create a .env-file and add your own SUPABASE_KEY and STRIPE_KEY

npm i

npx prisma generate

npm run dev
```
