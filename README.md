 AliExpress Clone

Created mainly as an exercise and almost everything is copied from [John Weeks](https://github.com/John-Weeks-Dev/aliexpress-clone). 
I didn't learn to build a Nuxt project from scratch per se, but I did kinda learn the structure and concept of NuxtJS, Tailwindcss, Prisma and how Supabase + OAuth works in this kind of application. 

To run this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/DepTrai95/aliexpress-clone.git

create a .env-file and add your own SUPABASE_KEY and STRIPE_KEY

npm i

npx prisma generate

npm run dev
```
